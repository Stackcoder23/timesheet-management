## Assumptions

- The project is a timesheet management application for tracking work hours and related data.
- User authentication and data persistence may be handled via API routes or external services.
- The project is set up for deployment on Vercel.
- The codebase is designed to be modular and scalable, using the latest features of Next.js and React.
